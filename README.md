Optimize flow table transfer during the VM migration
====================================================

A Small Introduction of the project:
-----------------------------------
* Software Defined Networks is relatively new domain which decouples the data and control flow in network
* VM Migration is an important metric for evaluation network virtualization and cloud computing domain.
* We propose an algorithm which will figure out the order and priority of the rules to migrate from the flow tables of routers when migrating the Virtual Machines in a network using OpenFlow protocol.
